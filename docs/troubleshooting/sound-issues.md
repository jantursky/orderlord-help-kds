## The order came, but no sound
This issue occurs if:
- the sound notifications are disabled. You could enable then with [this guide.]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/general-section/sound-info-notifications.md %})
- the volume of the tablet is {% include icon.html name="volume_down" %} decreased to almost zero or zero. Locate the volume buttons and increase to the maximum
- it's probably, that the {% include icon.html name="do_not_disturb_on" %} **"Do not Disturb mode"** is activated. Then you need to deactivate this mode or [enable access for the Kitchen application]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/frequently-asked-questions-faq/what-is-the-disturb-mode.md %})
- else contact [the support](mailto:support@orderlord.com), and we will try to solve the issue
