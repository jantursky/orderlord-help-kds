## Wrong timezone
If the orders are showing the wrong time, the issue could be with the wrong timezone, date or time. <span class="text-red-200">Be aware, that some manufacturer devices (mostly _Chinese brands_) contains a bug, which is causing that even if you setup correct timezone for your area, the device will (mostly after restart the Android device or synchronization with their website) change the timezone to the wrong timezone (for instance timezone of the manufacturer).</span> For a better overview, you could notice that through wrong date+time information on the **Kitchen screen** on the bottom. You just need to compare the device date and time with the real-time. For a better final solving this bug, you could set up manually timezone of the device in {% include icon.html name="settings" %} _the Android device settings_.

## Wrong date or time
<span class="text-red-200">Same as the issue with the [wrong timezone issue](#wrong-timezone), check if the device date and time is the correct one.</span> You could also set up device date and time manually for better control of the device in {% include icon.html name="settings" %} _the Android device settings_.
