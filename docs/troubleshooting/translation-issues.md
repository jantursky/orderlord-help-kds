## Weird translation
If you think, that the word or sentence, we used in the application, isn't the correct one or doesn't describe correctly the meaning, [let us know](mailto:support@orderlord.com). We are able to create many language packs, with the customized text translations for specific purposes.

## Misspelled word
It could happen, that during using the application, the user can find the additional letter or missing letter in the translation of the text. If you will find this, please, contact [the support](mailto:support@orderlord.com) with the screenshot or the more specific description where is this _typo_.

## Support more translations
If you wanted to have the Kitchen application translated into your native language, [follow this guide.]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/frequently-asked-questions-faq/how-to-support-your-language.md %})

## Missing translated text
The application by itself contains more than 5000 texts (like words, sentences, plural variants, etc.). Even that we are using development tools, that contain comparing missing text translations, it could happen, that we will lose some text translation. In such a case, [contact us](mailto:support@orderlord.com) and we will solve that as soon, as possible.
