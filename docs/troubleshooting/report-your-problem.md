## Description
Once the problem of any type will occur, and the user isn't able to solve the problem by himself not even by the [troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md %}), the last option is to contact [the support team](mailto:support@orderlord.com), which will try to help. But even the support team needs sometimes a bit more information about the problem, like _identifier of the order, delivery, user, account or the problem_. Thanks to this specific info, we are able to solve the issue faster.

## How to report the problem
- Open the menu from the left side

{% include img.html name="section_report_problem_1.png" %}

- Find {% include icon.html name="bug_report" %} [**Report problem**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/list-of-settings.md %}) option and click on it. The dialog for the reporting will be displayed.

- Add the description of the problem. Try to be more specific and mention also _an identifier_ of the specific data (like _Order number 19 is missing bacon_). You could also add the contact email, where our support team will contact you as soon as possible. You could also add attachments for a better description of the problem. You could take screenshots in multiple ways:
	- pressing two buttons on your Android device; normally the volume down and power button. 
	- on other devices, you might need to use the home button + power button combo.
	- either way, press the two buttons simultaneously and hold for a second.
When the right button combo is pressed, your deviceâ€™s screen will flash, usually accompanied by a camera shutter sound. Sometimes, a pop-up message or notification alert appears, suggesting that the screenshot has been made. Once the screenshot was taken, you could add it to the report of the problem.

- Once you have prepared all the information for reporting the problem, click on the <span class="text-green-100">**SEND**</span> button. During the first-time sending the report, the application will prompt you to **ACCESS THE CONTACTS** permission. This permission is needed for displaying the list of available Google Accounts, that are added into the Android device. Click on the <span class="text-green-100">**ALLOW**</span> button.

- The list of available Google Accounts will be displayed and select any **gmail.com** option, which will be used for sending the report as a new email.

- When you select any **gmail.com** option, click on the <span class="text-green-100">**OK**</span> button. The report will start to send information about the problem also with additional data, like _application database_ (for testing purposes), _basic information about the Android device_, etc.

{% include img.html name="section_report_problem_6.png" %}

- <span class="text-red-200">if you receive an **"Email not allowed"** error while sending a message, the email account you used to send the report is not enabled for Gmail. Enable this option in your Google Account settings, ask your Google Account administrator to enable this option, or create a new personal Google Account that should have this option enabled automatically. After enabling this option, select **"Reset Google Account"** when sending the report and try sending the report again.</span>
