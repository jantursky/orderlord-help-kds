# Finish the order
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Description
If the order was handed over to the customer by courier, at the store, or the customer has completed the order for a restaurant order, the order is finished (collected). If you aren't going to use **Point of sale Android application**, **Web Dashboard** or **Driver application**, then this functionality is right for you.

## How to do that?
Once you click on this row, the order will be set as finished and will dismiss from the Kitchen application. Only the place, where you are able to check this order, is from the [**Orders history section.**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/orders-history-section/orders-history-section.md %}) You could enable visibility of this button by following [**this guide.**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/data-section/show-button-for-finishing-of-orders.md %})

## Warning
If you aren't able to find this setting in the settings section, it's because this setting is disabled by the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_).
