## Description
If you need to cancel the order directly from the kitchen application, then this option is right for you. Once the order was cancelled, the order will dismiss from the application, only the place, where you are able to find it, is from [**Orders history section.**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/orders-history-section/orders-history-section.md %})

## How to do that?
- click on the _left block of the row_ (for instance **"Beef"** row)
- **or** _long click_ on the whole row (for instance **"Beef"** row)
- when the new dialog with the list of the options is displayed, click on the row {% include icon.html name="cancel" %} **"Cancel order"**.
- progress dialog will be displayed, and trying to contact with the server to cancel the order
- once the order was cancelled, all meals also with the whole order will disappear from the application

## Warning
If you aren't able to find this setting in the settings section, it's because this setting is disabled by the administrator of the account (_you need to ask for the access_).
