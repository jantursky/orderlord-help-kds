- Open the application **"Orderlord KDS"** (or **"Kitchen"**). Type on the first input line **Email** assigned email for the cook. The format of the login name should be an email address, like **test@gmail.com** (just as an example). Be aware to not add spaces on the start or end of the input.

- Type the password for the user. Once you click on the {% include icon.html name="visibility_off" %} eye icon on the right, the password will be displayed (for control purposes). Then click on the <span class="text-orange-200">**Login**</span> button.

- **During first logging into the application**, the Android system will prompt the dialog to allow "Access for reading/writing into storage". This permission is used for the purposes of sending log reports and creating a backup for the user's application settings which will be later restored from the storage.

- The application will try to check that the credentials are valid and sign in. The user is then moved to the [**Kitchen screen**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/getting-started/how-to-use-the-kitchen-screen.md %}).
