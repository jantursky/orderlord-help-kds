## Description
If you want to reset status for all meals for the specific order, you could do that with **Reset the order** option. That means, that even if the meal was already <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>/<span class="text-green-200">**prepared**</span>, this status will be removed from all meals of this order. Ready status for the order will be also removed.


## How to do that?
- click on the _left block of the row_ (for instance **"Beef"** row)
- **or** _long click_ on the whole row (for instance **"Beef"** row)
- when the new dialog with the list of the options is displayed, click on the row {% include icon.html name="settings_backup_restore" %} **"Reset order"**.
- progress dialog will be displayed, and trying to contact with the server to reset the order
- once the order was reset, all meals for this food will setup the empty status


## Warning
This row is displaying only if this action is enabled for the account in the account settings (handled by administrator of the account).
