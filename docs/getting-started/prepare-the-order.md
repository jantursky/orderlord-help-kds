## Description
If you want to speed up the process of setup all food for the specific order to <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>/<span class="text-green-200">**prepared**</span>, you could do that through the <span class="text-green-200">**PREPARE ORDER**</span> button. 

## How to do that?
When you click on this button, all meals will be <span class="text-orange-200">**cooked**</span>/<span class="text-green-200">**prepared**</span> and the order will disappear because it reached the maximum state for all meals. You could enable visibility of this button by following [**this guide.**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/data-section/show-button-for-preparing-of-orders.md %})
