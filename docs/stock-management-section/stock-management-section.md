## Description
The section is displaying the current availability status of every meal from single/multiple restaurants. The user can set the flag for a meal that is no longer available in the kitchen (all supplies for the meal were spent) and filter the meals multiple ways.

<span class="text-red-200">If the user can't see this section, it's disabled for the account in the account settings. **Ask the administrator of the account to enable this section.**</span>
