## How to filter
For faster finding a specific item, the user can filter the data in multiple ways:
1. Typing the searched phrase in the input line. The results are dynamically filtered during typing. The results will be highlighted <span class="text-green-200">**green color**</span> and underlined.
2. By specifying the values of [filtering options](#list-of-filtering-types). The user can use a combination of multiple options.

## List of filtering types
1. **CHANGES** - you could filter all types of items which are <span class="text-green-200">**in stock**</span> or <span class="text-red-200">**out of stock**</span>
1. **ITEM TYPES** - you could filter **all types** or only **meals**, **deals**, **meals with variable price**, **pizzas**, **pizza deals** or **additions**
1. **SELECTED STORE** - select one of the stores for what the items will be filtered or for every store
1. **SELECTED BRAND** - select one of the brands for what the items will be filtered or for every brand
