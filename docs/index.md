## How to install the application
- One way to install an app on your Android device is to use the official link in the **Google Play app**. You could follow [this guide to install the app](getting-started/how-to-install-the-application). Or use this direct link:

{% include app_links_google_play.html %}

- The second way is to install the application from this link from the **ApkPure.com** website (always try to check if the version on the website is the latest one compared with Google Play website - **<span class="text-green-100">x.x.x</span> for Android**):

{% include app_links_apkpure.html %}
