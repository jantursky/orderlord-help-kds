# How to support your language?
{: .no_toc }

We are supporting _12 language mutations_. If you need to translate the application into your language, we will need **your help**. Right now, we don't have the capacity for quality translation of all texts into another language. 

## But you could help us
We will provide you the application texts, with already prepared places, where you need to add a new translation or improved already translated text. After you have edited or revised the texts, you can send texts back to us and we will implement the texts that will be available with the new language version along with the language or we can forward the previous beta version to the translations for review.
