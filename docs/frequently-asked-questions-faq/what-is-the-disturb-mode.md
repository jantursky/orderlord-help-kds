## What is the Disturb mode
{% include icon.html name="do_not_disturb" %} **Do Not Disturb** allows you to limit or completely silence notifications and alerts on your device. It’s more powerful than simply putting your phone on **silent mode**. Here are a few examples of where Do Not Disturb can come in handy:

- automatically mute notifications every night while you sleep
- mute all interruptions until your alarm goes off
- automatically mute sounds while you’re in a meeting
- mute all interruptions except your favorite people
- you can see how **Do Not Disturb** can be very useful in your everyday life. Notifications can be a huge distraction. **Do Not Disturb** manages notifications with three different levels of silence:

1. **Total silence** – completely mutes your phone. Nothing will get through. Not even alarms.
1. **Alarms only** – as the name implies, this is like Total Silence except alarms still work.
1. **Priority only** – mutes everything except alarms, people, reminders, and events that you choose.

## How to TURN OFF Disturb mode

- Navigate to the {% include icon.html name="settings" %} settings section. 
- If the highlighted red row is displaying {% include icon.html name="do_not_disturb_on" %} **"Do Not Disturb" mode**, click on this row. If this row is not displaying, [enable the sound notification]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/general-section/sound-info-notifications.md %}). If this setting is enabled, Check to see if this row appears after the sound notifications are enabled. If not, then that means, that this application already granted access to handle **"Do Not Disturb" mode**.
