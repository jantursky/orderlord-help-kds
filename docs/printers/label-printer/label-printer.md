## Description
If you need to stick (attach) label on the box with the meal for the customer (for delivery or collection orders, mostly), then you could use **label printer** functionality. If for the purposes of your business, you need to attach additional data on the label, about order, customer, or restaurant data, then you could use [customization of the label]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/printers/label-printer/customize-the-label.md %}) functionality.
