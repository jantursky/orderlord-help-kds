## Description
The cook can setup 3 ways, how the label will be printed:
1. Once the specific food is **cooked** - when the cook sets out the food has been cooked, the automatic printing logic will be triggered and start to print that food (one or multiple times, depending on the quantity, [depending on the setting]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/label-printer-section/label-quantity.md %}) 
1. Once the specific food s **prepared**- same as above condition, but for the prepared state 
1. Only by manually printing - this selected option will not trigger automatic printing of the labels. But this option will add a additional option in the **List of options** for the row called {% include icon.html name="label" %} **Print label**. Once the cook will click on this row, the label printer will print the label for that food.
