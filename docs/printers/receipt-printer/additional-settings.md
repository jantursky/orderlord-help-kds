## List of settings
1. [**Receipt reprints**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/printers/receipt-printer/customize-the-receipt.md %}) - determine how many receipts should be printed for every order
1. [**Kitchen reprints**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/printers/receipt-printer/customize-the-receipt.md %}) - determine how many kitchen receipts should be printed for every order
1. [**Characters per line**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/receipt-printer-section/characters-per-line.md %}) - depending on the vendor and model of the printer, you need to set up a number of characters per line. The default value is 42 characters but you need to check that depending on the setup of your printer.
1. [**Empty lines at the start**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/receipt-printer-section/empty-lines-at-the-start-end.md %}) - how many empty lines should be printed before starting to print the first line
1. [**Empty lines at the end**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/receipt-printer-section/empty-lines-at-the-start-end.md %}) - how many empty lines should be printed after the last printed line on the end
1. [**Autoprint functionality**]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/list-of-settings/receipt-printer-section/autoprint.md %}) - after enabling this functionality, when a new order will come to the application (even if itâ€™s a future order), the application will try to create a connection with a setup printer and print receipts and kitchen receipts depending on the count set up in the configuration
