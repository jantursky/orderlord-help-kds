## Description
When the user in the kitchen needs to print a receipt for the customer or kitchen receipt for the overview of the order on the paper for the kitchen receipt holder, then you could use **receipt printer** functionality. If for the purposes of your business, you need to attach additional data on the receipt, about an order, customer, or restaurant data, then you could use [customization of the receipt]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/printers/receipt-printer/customize-the-receipt.md %}) functionality.
