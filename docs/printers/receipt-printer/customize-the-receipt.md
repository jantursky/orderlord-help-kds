## How to use
In the category {% include icon.html name="receipt" %} **Receipt printer**, find the row {% include icon.html name="format_list_numbered" %} **Receipt design** or {% include icon.html name="format_list_numbered" %} **Kitchen reprint design** (depending on your purposes). Click on the row, the new screen will be displayed.

{% include img.html name="receipt_printer_customize_receipt_3.png" %}

On the left side is the list of all information about the order, that could be printed on the receipt. This list is vertically scrollable, and every information is customizable by a [list of options](#list-of-options). The right side is displaying the preview of the receipt (_visualization_). You could find much faster the receipt information on the left side by clicking on the specific information on this visualized receipt.
