## Description
The list of orders created in the system. The user can search for the specific order/orders by typing **order ID**, **order counter** or **customer phone** or by filtering with multiple filter types. 

<span class="text-red-200">If the user doesn't see any results even for the time intervals when orders were created and stored in the system, this is because the user doesn't have the permission. **Ask the administrator of the account for this permission.**</span>
